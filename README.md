# RRnlp

This library provides (easy!) access to a suite of models for extracting key data from abstracts of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). 

In particular, `rrnlp` features lightweight variants of the models defined in Trialstreamer (https://trialstreamer.robotreviewer.net/; https://academic.oup.com/jamia/article/27/12/1903/5907063). However, the models here — all save for the sample size extractor constructed as linear layers on top of `SciBERT` representations, with only minimal fine tuning of `SciBERT` layers — are still experimental, and may not be as performant as the models used in Trialstreamer (yet!). See below for example usage. 

# Use

```python
import rrnlp

trial_reader = rrnlp.TrialReader()

ti_abs = {"ti": 'A Cluster-Randomized Trial of Hydroxychloroquine for Prevention of Covid-19',
          "ab": '''Background: Current strategies for preventing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection are limited to nonpharmacologic interventions. Hydroxychloroquine has been proposed as a postexposure therapy to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), but definitive evidence is lacking.\n\nMethods: We conducted an open-label, cluster-randomized trial involving asymptomatic contacts of patients with polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR)-confirmed Covid-19 in Catalonia, Spain. We randomly assigned clusters of contacts to the hydroxychloroquine group (which received the drug at a dose of 800 mg once, followed by 400 mg daily for 6 days) or to the usual-care group (which received no specific therapy). The primary outcome was PCR-confirmed, symptomatic Covid-19 within 14 days. The secondary outcome was SARS-CoV-2 infection, defined by symptoms compatible with Covid-19 or a positive PCR test regardless of symptoms. Adverse events were assessed for up to 28 days.\n\nResults: The analysis included 2314 healthy contacts of 672 index case patients with Covid-19 who were identified between March 17 and April 28, 2020. A total of 1116 contacts were randomly assigned to receive hydroxychloroquine and 1198 to receive usual care. Results were similar in the hydroxychloroquine and usual-care groups with respect to the incidence of PCR-confirmed, symptomatic Covid-19 (5.7% and 6.2%, respectively; risk ratio, 0.86 [95% confidence interval, 0.52 to 1.42]). In addition, hydroxychloroquine was not associated with a lower incidence of SARS-CoV-2 transmission than usual care (18.7% and 17.8%, respectively). The incidence of adverse events was higher in the hydroxychloroquine group than in the usual-care group (56.1% vs. 5.9%), but no treatment-related serious adverse events were reported.\n\nConclusions: Postexposure therapy with hydroxychloroquine did not prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection or symptomatic Covid-19 in healthy persons exposed to a PCR-positive case patient.

# Installing

*NOTE*: As of mid-October 2021, installing `rrnlp` via `pip` does not cooperate well with python 3.10; we suggest using 3.9.

The easiest way to install the latest version is via `pip`. 

```bash
pip install rrnlp
```

(Model weights will then be downloaded as needed when you import `rrnlp`.) We suggest using a custom environment, so if you're using `conda` this might look something like

```bash
conda create --name rrnlp python=3.9
conda activate rrnlp
pip install rrnlp
```

Alternatively, if you want to use the bleeding-edge (for better or worse) you can try installing directly via `git`

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/bwallace/RRnlp.git
```

(Or can `clone` and then `install .` locally.)
